## What is Red Hat OpenShift Service on AWS (ROSA)?
ROSA is a _fully_ managed Red Hat OpenShift cluster running natively on Amazon Web Services (AWS), which allows customers to quickly and easily build, deploy, and manage Kubernetes applications on the industryâ€™s most comprehensive Kubernetes platform in the AWS public cloud. 

## What information is on this site?
These pages are split into 2 sections. One contains the steps to getting started on ROSA.  Another is about deploying an application to ROSA to get better familiar with the internals of OpenShift.

## Quick preview of the ROSA cluster deployment
If you'd like a preview of the cluster deployment process, you can watch a short demo:
